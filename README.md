# hate-speech-detection

### Intro:
This is an NLP project in which I will be train and deploy a classification model to identify hateful/abusive speech in a given set of text (ex. social media posts).

### Datasets:
For this project, I will be using a Twitter Post data set from Kaggle consisting of 56,745 examples that fall under 2 labels: 0 for "no-hate" and 1 for "hate/abusive".
